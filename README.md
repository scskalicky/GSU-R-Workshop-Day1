# GSU-R-Workshop (Day 1)
 May 2024 R Stats and Data Visualisation Workshop

## Installing R and R Studio

You should have the latest versions of R and R Studio installed on your computer. 

[Andy Field has a short (and humorous) guide on how to do so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvPFKfNHBNQ&ab_channel=AndyField).

You can find [a more detailed guide from Andy Field here](https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-overview), should you want an overview of R studio.
